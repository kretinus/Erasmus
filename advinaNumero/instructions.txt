Guess the number

Things to consider in the program logic

1. generate a random number between 1 and 100
2. save the player's current guess number, starting with guess 1.
3. give the player a way to guess the number
4. once the number is entered, record it somewhere so the player can see their guesses.
5. next, check if the number is correct.

6. if correct:
i. display a congratulatory message
ii. make it impossible for the player to eneter any mre guesses.
iii. display a control that allows the player to play again


7. if incorrect and the player has mire guesses remaining
i.tell the player theey failed
ii. tell the player to try again
iii. increase the number of attempts by 1

8. if the player fails and has no attempts left:
i.tell the player the game is over
ii. make it so the player cannot input any other guesses.
iii. display a control that allows the player to restart the game.

9. once the game restarts, make sure the game logic and ui are fully reset, then return to step 1.
